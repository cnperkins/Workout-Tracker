Title: Workout Tracker

Description: This is a Fitness Tracker. After running 'node server.js' in the terminal and going to loaclhost:3000, (or using the heroku link) the user will be able add new workouts or continue workout. They can choose form cardio or resistance and fill in the boxes, either completing the workout or adding more. In the dashboard you can see two charts detailing the days, workouts, distance and pounds. To create this app I use a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

Here is a deployed link to Heroku:
